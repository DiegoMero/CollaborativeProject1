        <div id="image-caption">German physicist of Jewish origin, nationalized later Swiss, Austrian and American. He is considered the most important, well-known and popular scientist of the 20th century. </div>
      <div id="tribute-info">In 1915, he presented the theory of general relativity, in which he completely reformulated the concept of gravity. One of the consequences was the emergence of the scientific study of the origin and evolution of the universe by the branch of physics called cosmology. In 1919, when British observations of a solar eclipse confirmed his predictions about the bending of light, he was idolized by the press. Einstein became a world famous popular icon of science, a privilege available to very few scientists.
        For his explanations of the photoelectric effect and his numerous contributions to theoretical physics, in 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics and not for the Theory of Relativity, since the scientist who was entrusted with the task of evaluating it did not understand it, and they feared run the risk of later being proven wrong. At that time it was still considered somewhat controversial.
        Faced with the rise of Nazism, Einstein left Germany in December 1932 for the United States, where he devoted himself to teaching at the Institute for Advanced Study. He became a US citizen in 1940. During his last years he worked to integrate gravitational and electromagnetic forces into the same theory.
        Although considered by some to be the "father of the atomic bomb", he advocated world federalism, internationalism, pacifism, Zionism, and democratic socialism, with a strong devotion to individual freedom and freedom of expression. He was proclaimed "person of the 20th century" and the most preeminent scientist by Time magazine.</div>
